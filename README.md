# Ã†ternity identity

The identity provider is a relatively simple app, that allows apps, which are loaded
via an iframe to interact with the ethereum network by providing an web3 instance.
To make this happen only a couple of things need to be paid attention to; first of
all since the apps are loaded via an iframe, same origin policies apply. To load
the parent web3 instance you can modify your usual check to detect metamask like
this:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
  if (window.web3) {
    web3.setProvider(window.web3.currentProvider);
  } else if (window.parent !== window && window.parent.web3 !== undefined) {
    web3.setProvider(window.parent.web3.currentProvider);
  }
});
```

You also need to make sure that there are no synchronous calls to any of the web3
functions which issue API calls, e.g. instead of `web3.eth.accounts` use `web.eth.getAccounts(function (err, accounts) {...})`.
